about:
Kamp Kreativity is a haven for cultivating creative and critical thinking skills for children and families across the East Bay Area. Located in the heart of Oakland, Kamp Kreativity aspires to uplift those in under-resourced and underprivileged schools through educational camps, learning activities, and other forms of educational entertainment that help cultivate an environment that promotes learning and personal growth through education in Oakland's Lake Merritt. Kamp Kreativity also aspires to make a change in our community with all proceeds that aren't spent on the materials at the camps all going to local foundations such as The Junior Center of Art and Science and under-resourced schools.The striving goal for the organization is to help provide equal learning opportunities to all children across the bay no matter the economic status of their schools or institutions. Kamp Kreativity believes that the joy of learning and self discovery is something we are all entitled to so actively works to make that change with their camps each year.
 

technical overview:
To appeal to our audience of families, parents/guardians, and children the visuals used were all chosen to be hand-drawn sketches in a bright orange against a white background. For the text, Roboto was chosen for its large and legible form and chape which make it easy to read for people of all ages.
