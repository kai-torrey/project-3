about:
Kamp Kreativity is a haven for cultivating creative and critical thinking skills for children and families across the East Bay Area. Located in the heart of Oakland, Kamp Kreativity aspires to uplift those in under-resourced and underprivileged schools through educational camps, learning activities, and other forms of entertainment that help cultivate an environment that promotes learning and personal growth through education in Okalands Lake Merrit. Kamp Kreativity also aspires to make a change in our community with all proceeds that aren't spent on the materials at the camps all going to local foundations such as The Junior Center of Art and Science and under-resourced schools. 

technical overview:
To appeal to our audience of families, parents/guardians, and children the visuals used were all chosen to be hand-drawn sketches in a bright orange against a white background. For the text, Roboto was chosen for its large and legible form and chape which make it easy to read for people of all ages.
